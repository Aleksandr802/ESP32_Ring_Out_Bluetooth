# ESP32 Ring Out Bluetooth

This project is an ESP32-based application that leverages Bluetooth capabilities to interact with external devices. It is built using the Arduino framework and PlatformIO for streamlined development and deployment.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Keyboard Support**: Uses the [ESP32 BLE Keyboard](https://platformio.org/lib/show/11416/ESP32%20BLE%20Keyboard) library to emulate a Bluetooth keyboard.
- **Audio Processing**: Integrates the [Muse Library](https://platformio.org/lib/show/12345/Muse_library) for advanced audio functionalities.
- **ESP32-A2DP Library**: Includes the [ESP32-A2DP](https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP) library for Bluetooth audio streaming, supporting both A2DP sink (receiver) and source (sender) modes.
- **I2S Audio Output**: Utilizes the ESP32's I2S interface for high-quality audio output.

## Project Structure

- **src**: Contains the main application code.
- **lib**: Includes project-specific libraries like ESP32-A2DP.
- **`platformio.ini`**: Configuration file for PlatformIO, specifying dependencies and build settings.
- **include**: Header files for the project.
- **`.vscode/`**: VS Code configuration files for debugging and development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) in your IDE (e.g., VS Code).
3. Open the project folder in your IDE.
4. Build and upload the firmware to your ESP32 board.
